                    <p>Welcome to my first blogpost! <br> A lot has happened since leaving Shell end September. The MBA program has started and I am almost done with my <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009" target="_blank">online machine learning degree</a> from Udacity.</p>

                    <p> The MBA has been useful in a number of ways: Technically, I have learned how (SQL) databases work, got some solid grounding in statistics and econometrics and learned programming in R. As a large scale data challenge for an assignment, I have checked if any of my linkedin contacts has been involved in the Panama Papers scandal (contact me to learn more about, if I found you in there).</p>
					
					<p> Further, I learned how to implement commercial (big) data projects and analyze consumer behavior, went to start-up pitches, the Benelux AI and big data conferences. <br>A big learning point was also the self-reflection journey (thanks Shell colleagues for the farewell feedback!). I am developing much more patience with others and myself and a more genuine interest in people's stories - there is so much to learn, if you just listen carefully.</p>
					
					<p>Regarding commercial activities, I have so far engaged in little project work (prohibitive tax rates this year!), as learning is still most important until the end of 2016. I have done two small international consulting jobs, one for reactor engineering and catalysis and another for industrial automation. Further, I have been in touch with an <a href="https://sustanalyze.com/" target="_blank">Utrecht based start-up</a> giving them advice on how to market their software product - it's a sustainability screening tool for chemicals R&D.<br> I attended a grant proposal session alongside the CEO and gave my perspective as ex-R&D coordinator, i.e. customer, on the need for such a tool to the jury panel. He actually got the grant this week!</p>
				
					<p>On the more fun side, I have hosted 2 Lego building workshops for elementary school kids and we also went to the biggest Lego convention in the Netherlands, see pictures below.</p>

                    </a>
					
					<p> A youtube video of my son watching a Lego-built rubic's cube solver (we will build that around X-mas).</p>
					
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFaZR1bdTZ4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					
					<p> I got in touch with an <a href="http://newtechkids.com/en/" target="_blank">Amsterdam based start-up</a> - they develop computer science lessons for elementary schools. Further, I will be a judge at the Lego national robot building competition in 2017. I am quite passionate about this and think there is a dire need to start as early as possible - the future for today's kids will be all digital and blended with artificial intelligence.</p>
				
					<p>I am slowly converging on my path forward â€¦ combining what I know with what I am most exciting about, see triangle below. What's the job I will do combining these 3 skillsets?</p>

                    </a>
					
					<p>What helped a lot is talking to my 5 year old son. He kept asking what I would do, now that I am not making gasoline anymore. If you cannot describe it to a child, you often do not even understand it yourself. I eventually told him I would want to build robots and that was the igniting spark! Ever since he is helping me get better at making robots, see below we are building a Lego mindstorms robot.</p>

                    </a>
					
					<p>I am really intrigued by building self-learning automated systems... bringing AI to life in my domain. Recently, I have programmed a taxi that learns traffic rules in a Manhattan like street-grid in Python (Q-learning). Now I am working on computer vision via deep neural networks using Google's Tensorflow. Next I want to program a self-learning algorithm and load it onto my Lego Mindstorms robot with vision sensor so it can learn to navigate the house. Stay tuned for more updates! Next: End of December.</p>
